// integer and thus still ambiguous. SO...the parallel constructor requires
// an enumerated type as the first argument: tft8 (for 8-bit parallel) or
// tft16 (for 16-bit)...even though 16-bit isn't fully implemented or tested
// and might never be, still needed that disambiguation from soft SPI.

// CLASS DEFINITION --------------------------------------------------------

/*!
  @brief  Riscduino_SPITFT is an intermediary class between Adafruit_GFX
          and various hardware-specific subclasses for different displays.
          It handles certain operations that are common to a range of
          displays (address window, area fills, etc.). Originally these were
          all color TFT displays interfaced via SPI, but it's since expanded
          to include color OLEDs and parallel-interfaced TFTs. THE NAME HAS
          BEEN KEPT TO AVOID BREAKING A LOT OF SUBCLASSES AND EXAMPLE CODE.
          Many of the class member functions similarly live on with names
          that don't necessarily accurately describe what they're doing,
          again to avoid breaking a lot of other code. If in doubt, read
          the comments.
